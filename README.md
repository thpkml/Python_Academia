# Academia: A super simple app
A single page application to manage academic works of teaching staff. 
## Client Requirements
ABC College's senior management team decided to develop a system for maintaining staffâ€™s scholarly activities.  
The new system will be maintaining the following records:
- Staff name 
- department
- job title
- contract type (full/part time)
- date joined ABC
- scholarly activity
- date of the activity etc. 
(you are free to make logical assumptions and justify them).  
The staff will be able to input the above records and update their progress on scholarly activities.  
The system will mainly be used by the Vice-Principal of Research & Enterprise.  
He should be able to track whether staff (investigators) received the requested resources to conduct their 
activities and progress on the activities.
